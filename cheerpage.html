			<h1 style="text-align:center">Cheerleading</h1>
			<h2>Emma Szwast</h2>
			<p> This was my first year participating in cheer, and I am very happy to have recently made both football and basketball squads for next year. I am very grateful to my best friend who convinced me to go out for the team because I definitely wouldn't have done it otherwise. My favorite part about cheerleading is getting to be a part of such an amazing squad who is always there for each other.</p>
			<h4> Some of my favorite cheers </h3>
			<ul>
				<li>We got 'em scared</li>
				<li>Rock steady</li>
				<li>Rock with the white and roll with the blue</li>
				<li>Knights on your feet</li>
				<li>Across the nation</li>
				<p>
