			<h2>Emma Szwast</h2>
			<p> This is my first year participating in cheer, I am very grateful to my best friend who convinced me to go out for the team. My favorite part about cheerleading is getting to be a part of such an amazing squad who is always there for each other.</p>
			<h4> Some of my favorite cheers </h3>
			<ul>
				<li>We got 'em scared</li>
				<li>Rock steady</li>
				<li>Rock with the white and roll with the blue</li>
				<li>Knights on your feet</li>
				<li>Across the nation</li>
				<p>
